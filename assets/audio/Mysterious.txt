Music Walking alone tonight Pause the stations signs Something doesn't feel right Since you changed your mind My fossil has your name These streets feel the same But everything's changed Everything's changed I'm the reason all the memories No reason, no reason Trying to delete you from my history Walking through the poor, you're aimlessly Aimlessly, aimlessly I can't remember what we used to be Scream light in my face Through the rain and the haze Every eye I see Brings you back to me My fossil has your name These streets feel the same But everything's changed Everything's changed I'm the reason all the memories No reason, no reason Trying to delete you from my history Walking through the poor, you're aimlessly I can't remember what we used to be Music Can't press undo Can't go back to you System overload Time to let you go I'm using all the memories Trying to delete you from my history Walking through the poor, you're aimlessly Aimlessly, aimlessly I can't remember what we used to be Music
